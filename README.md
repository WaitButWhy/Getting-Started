# Getting-Started
We all love WaitButWhy.com, the brainchild of Tim Urban and Andrew Finn, and they are both great at tons of stuff...just not so much the web dev stuff. So to free up Tim from worrying about the website and enable him to simply worry about his next massively long and wildly entertaing post (and all the angst ridden sleepless nights that will go with it) we're putting together a team of web devs and such that can help out.

# Some basics
- Do stuff that we love
This is a volunteer group of people that simply love WBW, as such everything is done on a "you are awesome" basis and that stuff should just be fun.
- Egos? No egos
Sure we all HAVE them, just not here.
- Pragmatic approach
There are a million things that we could do, we're just gonna focus on very specific incremental changes to the site to start. 
- My role
I work with Tim and Andrew as the CTO of ArborBridge.com and truePrep.com. My role with this group is to communicate their ideas and your ideas to make WBW the best non-blog blog on the web (http://waitbutwhy.com/faq).

# Setup
- WBW is a WordPress site hosted at WPEngine
- We have a staging environment at http://waitbutwhy.staging.wpengine.com
- WBW has a custom template
- There is extensive utilization of third-party plugins
